        Nature is beautiful because it is alive, moving, and reproductive. It contrasts with the static or deteriorating state of man-made things1. Nature includes everything around us, such as mountains, forests, rivers, birds, plants, animals, and air. It provides us with everything we need to sustain and survive2. Being immersed in nature can bring peace to the mind and ground a person, even in today's fast-paced world3. Nature has its own beauties for every time and season4. In nature, nothing is perfect and everything is perfect.
